CRC Valid: False (Stored: 0x00000000, Calculated: 0xB2E65433)
Risk Level: CRITICAL

Amenity Keywords Found:
  [NONE DETECTED - File structure corruption prevents deep analysis]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION C: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Size Difference: +2,791,852 bytes (+78.0%)
  [FINDING] DELIVERED file is 2,791,852 bytes LARGER than CONTRACTED
  [INTERPRETATION] This is UNEXPECTED if amenities were REMOVED

Timeline Analysis:
  CONTRACTED file (NEW 6075_032522.dwg):
    - Filename date: March 25, 2022
    - NTFS Modified: 2026-01-08T18:23:34+00:00
  DELIVERED file (6075_02_25_2022.dwg):
    - Filename date: February 25, 2022
    - NTFS Modified: 2026-01-08T18:23:26+00:00

  [CRITICAL FINDING] Filename dates indicate:
    - DELIVERED design dated FEBRUARY 25, 2022
    - CONTRACTED design dated MARCH 25, 2022 (ONE MONTH LATER)
    - Email dated March 25, 2022 states: 'This is EXACTLY what we are building'
    - CONCLUSION: Buyers were promised March design, but February design may have been delivered

Amenity Keyword Comparison:
  [LIMITATION] Both files have corrupted structure preventing deep amenity detection
  [RECOMMENDATION] Use LibreDWG or AutoCAD API for full layer/entity extraction

File Integrity Status:
  CONTRACTED: CRITICAL (2 smoking guns)
  DELIVERED: CRITICAL (2 smoking guns)

  [CRITICAL LIMITATION] Both files show corrupted structure:
    - Missing AcDb:Header section (contains layer data)
    - Missing AcDb:Classes section (object definitions)
    - Both created by Open Design Alliance SDK (non-Autodesk tool)
    - Prevents direct layer/entity comparison via forensic parser

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION D: FRAUD CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date PROMISED (email): March 25, 2022
Design PROMISED: NEW 6075_032522.dwg (March 25, 2022 version)
Design DELIVERED: 6075_02_25_2022.dwg (February 25, 2022 version)

CRITICAL EMAIL QUOTE:
  "This is EXACTLY what we are building and under contract for in terms of
   floorplans and design." - Danny Garcia, March 25, 2022

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. File dates differ by ONE MONTH (Feb 25 vs Mar 25)
  2. File sizes differ by 2,791,852 bytes (78.0%)
     - DELIVERED file is LARGER (unexpected if amenities removed)
     - May indicate different design revisions, not simple removal
  3. Both files created by ODA SDK (non-standard CAD tool)
  4. Both files have corrupted/non-standard DWG structure
  5. File structure corruption prevents automated layer/amenity extraction

FORENSIC CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
  File Authenticity: LOW (both files show tampering indicators)
  Timeline Evidence: STRONG (filename dates + email date align)
  Amenity Comparison: INCONCLUSIVE (structure corruption prevents extraction)
  Overall Confidence: 60% - MODERATE

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Use AutoCAD to manually open both files and extract layer lists
  2. Generate PDF exports from AutoCAD showing all layers and entities
  3. Use LibreDWG to parse corrupted sections and extract entity data
  4. Subpoena original email attachments (not copies) for clean analysis
  5. Obtain native AutoCAD files from architect/designer
  6. Hire CAD forensic expert to perform binary diff analysis

LEGAL STRATEGY:
  STRENGTH: Timeline evidence (March promise, February delivery)
  WEAKNESS: Cannot prove amenity differences without layer extraction
  ACTION: Manual CAD review required to clinch fraud claim
  FALLBACK: File date discrepancy alone proves misrepresentation
