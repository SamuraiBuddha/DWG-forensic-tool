================================================================================
SCORING METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

The email parser uses a weighted scoring system to identify litigation-critical
emails:

SMOKING GUN KEYWORDS (Tampering/Fraud Indicators):
   delete: 5 points
   remove: 5 points
   destroy: 10 points
   backdated: 10 points
   tamper: 10 points
   modified after: 8 points
   change the date: 8 points
   hide: 7 points
   conceal: 7 points
   fraud: 10 points

AMENITY KEYWORDS (Subject Matter Relevance):
   amenities: 3 points
   pool: 2 points
   outdoor kitchen: 4 points
   bbq: 2 points
   waterfall: 3 points
   fireplace: 3 points
   retaining wall: 3 points
   landscape: 2 points

FILE REFERENCE KEYWORDS (Design Document References):
   lane.rvt: 5 points
   .dwg: 3 points
   .rvt: 3 points
   updated drawing: 4 points
   revised drawing: 4 points
   new version: 3 points
   attached file: 2 points

TOTAL SCORE = Smoking Gun + Amenity + File Reference

Emails are ranked by total score for SMOKING_GUN_EMAILS.txt report.

================================================================================
FORENSIC METADATA ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The parser performs automated timestamp forensic analysis:

TIMESTAMP ANOMALY DETECTION:
   1. Received before sent (impossible - indicates backdating)
   2. Delay > 72 hours (unusual - may indicate hold/release manipulation)
   3. Date range analysis (earliest to latest email)

RED FLAGS:
   - Email received timestamp precedes sent timestamp
   - Excessive delay between sent and received (> 72 hours)
   - Emails with modified headers (if detected by extract-msg)

VALIDATION:
   - All emails checked for timestamp consistency
   - Anomalies flagged in EMAIL_METADATA_FORENSICS.txt
   - CSV includes timestamp_anomaly column (YES/NO)

================================================================================
PARTY IDENTIFICATION
================================================================================

The parser automatically detects mentions of known parties:

PARTIES TRACKED:
   - Danny Garcia (Defendant)
   - Andy Ehrig (Architect)
   - Kara Murphy (Plaintiff)
   - Caron (Related Party)
   - Beauchamp (Related Party)
   - Gansari (Firm/Entity)

DETECTION METHOD:
   - Case-insensitive keyword search in subject + body
   - Tracks: 'garcia', 'andy', 'murphy', 'kara', 'caron', 'beauchamp', 'gansari'

OUTPUT:
   - parties_mentioned column in EMAIL_TIMELINE_MASTER.csv
   - PARTIES MENTIONED section in EMAIL_PARTY_COMMUNICATION_MATRIX.txt

================================================================================
EXHIBIT NUMBERING SCHEME
================================================================================

Format: Email-XXX (where XXX = chronological order 001-065)

EXAMPLE:
   Email-001: Earliest email by sent_date
   Email-065: Latest email by sent_date

BENEFITS:
   - Chronological ordering for timeline reconstruction
   - Consistent numbering for deposition exhibits
   - Cross-reference with deposition transcripts

USAGE IN DEPOSITION:
   "Referring to Exhibit Email-023, dated [DATE], from [SENDER] to [RECIPIENT],
    subject '[SUBJECT]', do you recall receiving this communication?"
