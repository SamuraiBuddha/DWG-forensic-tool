CRITICAL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

[FINDING 1] HIGH-CONFIDENCE PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS (3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: CLEAR PRIVILEGE - WITHHOLD FROM PRODUCTION

Documents:
1. JPEC Engagement letter Caron-Beauchamp v Garcia 08-21-25.docx
2. JPEC Engagement letter Caron-Beauchamp v Garcia 08-21-25.pdf
3. Correspondence to Opposing Counsel- 8.21.25.pdf

Legal Basis: Attorney-Client Privilege
Action Required: Include in privilege log, withhold from production
Attorney Review Time: 30 minutes (verification only)

[FINDING 2] EMAIL FILES REQUIRING CONTENT REVIEW (65)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: UNCERTAIN - REQUIRES MANUAL CONTENT REVIEW

Critical Issue:
ALL 65 email files are located in "Caron - Produce to John Ehrig" folder,
indicating they were PRODUCED BY opposing counsel (Caron law firm) TO us
during their document production.

Legal Analysis:
1. Opposing counsel deemed these emails non-privileged
2. Their production may constitute privilege waiver on their part
3. We should NOT automatically assert privilege on their waived documents
4. HOWEVER, if emails contain OUR attorney-client communications, we may
   still assert privilege
5. Content review required to determine if emails involve OUR counsel

Recommendation:
- Open each .msg file and review headers (To/From/CC/BCC)
- Read email content
- If email is between THEIR parties (not involving OUR counsel) = PRODUCE
- If email includes OUR attorney-client communications = May WITHHOLD
- Consult with counsel before asserting privilege

Attorney Review Time: 10-15 hours (10-15 minutes per email)

[FINDING 3] DEPOSITION MATERIALS (242 documents)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: DISCOVERABLE - PRODUCE

All 242 deposition transcripts and exhibits classified as DISCOVERABLE.
Deposition testimony is public record and NOT privileged.

Note: No deposition preparation materials were detected in this collection.
If deposition prep materials exist elsewhere, they would be work product.

Action Required: Produce all 242 documents
Attorney Review Time: 2 hours (spot-check only)

[FINDING 4] DESIGN FILES (497 documents)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: DISCOVERABLE - PRODUCE

All DWG, CAD, and Revit design files classified as DISCOVERABLE.
These are evidence, not attorney-client communications.

Action Required: Produce all 497 design files
Attorney Review Time: None required (clearly not privileged)

RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE RISK: MODERATE

Risks Identified:
1. 65 emails require content review (uncertain privilege status)
2. 554 documents already produced BY opposing counsel (may contain our privilege)
3. Email content NOT reviewed (filenames/paths only)

Mitigating Factors:
1. No LOW confidence privileged documents detected
2. Only 3 documents clearly privileged (engagement letters)
3. 82% of documents have HIGH confidence classifications
4. Comprehensive prevention protocol in place

Risk Mitigation:
1. Manual attorney review of all 68 flagged documents
2. Staged production in batches of 200 documents
3. Consider FRE 502(d) protective order
4. Clawback notice prepared and ready
