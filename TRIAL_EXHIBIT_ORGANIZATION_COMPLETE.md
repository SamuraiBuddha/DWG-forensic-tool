## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created

**C:\Users\JordanEhrig\Documents\GitHub\DWG-forensic-tool\**

1. `case_cataloger.py` (Original document cataloging)
   - Scanned all 1,040 documents
   - Generated CASE_DOCUMENT_INDEX.csv
   - Created directory maps and statistics

2. `trial_exhibit_organizer.py` (Initial version)
   - First attempt at topic categorization
   - All docs → AMENITIES (overly broad keywords)

3. `trial_exhibit_organizer_v2.py` (Improved version)
   - Better topic distribution using category logic
   - Partial deliverables

4. `trial_exhibit_organizer_final.py` (Production version)
   - Complete categorization logic
   - All 12 deliverables generated
   - Category-based + keyword-based topic assignment

### Categorization Logic

**Category-Based Rules**:
- Financial Records → FINANCIAL
- Deposition/Transcript → GENERAL
- Forensic Report/Analysis → TIMELINE (default) or FOUNDATION
- Email/Correspondence → Determined by keywords
- Design Files → AMENITIES (default) or FOUNDATION
- Permits/Approvals → FOUNDATION
- Survey Documents → FOUNDATION

**Keyword Fallbacks**:
- "forensic, timestamp, tamper" → TIMELINE
- "foundation, structural, survey" → FOUNDATION
- "invoice, payment, billing" → FINANCIAL
- "amenities, pool, bbq" → AMENITIES

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Review TRIAL_EXHIBIT_TOPIC_INDEX.csv
2. Identify 20 most critical smoking gun exhibits
3. Manually locate Lane.rvt and Lane.0024.rvt in exhibit index
4. Verify all forensic reports in T-001 to T-028
5. Review deposition exhibit list (G-001 to G-242) for completeness

### Short-Term Actions (Week 2-3)
1. Begin print production
2. Install AutoCAD/Revit viewers on trial laptop
3. Test digital exhibits
4. Create binder labels and tabs
5. Prepare exhibit stickers

### Pre-Trial Actions (Week 4)
