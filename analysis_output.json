CRC INTEGRITY ANALYSIS**  \n\n- **Stored CRC**: 0x00000000  \n- **Calculated CRC**: 0xC0D841ED  \n- **Result**: **Mismatch**\n\nA CRC mismatch is *definitive proof* that the file header was altered after the last legitimate AutoCAD (or compatible) save. AutoCAD recomputes and writes the CRC every time a file is saved; therefore, a mismatch can only arise if the file was modified by a tool that did **not** update the CRC. This indicates post\u2011save tampering or corruption.\n\n---\n\n**3. WATERMARK ANALYSIS**  \n\n- **Status**: No TrustedDWG watermark present; cryptographic validity = No.  \n- **Interpretation**: The absence of a TrustedDWG watermark means the file was **not** saved by a genuine Autodesk application, or the watermark was deliberately removed. Because the watermark is a proprietary cryptographic signature that cannot be forged, its absence is a strong indicator that the file did not originate from a compliant Autodesk save.  \n- **Limitations**: Some third\u2011party CAD programs can create DWG files without embedding a TrustedDWG watermark. Therefore, the lack of a watermark alone does **not** prove tampering; it only indicates non\u2011Autodesk origin or watermark removal.\n\n---\n\n**4. TIMESTAMP CROSS\u2011VALIDATION**  \n\n| Source | Timestamp | Value | Notes |\n|--------|-----------|-------|-------|\n| DWG (TDINDWG) | Cumulative editing time | 0.00\u202fh | No editing time recorded. |\n| DWG (TDCREATE / TDUPDATE) | Creation / last update | *Not available* | Cannot compute calendar span. |\n| NTFS $SI | Creation | 2026\u201101\u201111\u202f17:39:39\u202fUTC (909\u202f138\u202f400\u202fns) | |\n| NTFS $SI | Modification | 2026\u201101\u201111\u202f17:39:39\u202fUTC (945\u202f420\u202f900\u202fns) | |\n| NTFS $FILE_NAME | Creation | *Not available* | |\n\n- **TDINDWG vs. Calendar Span**: Because TDCREATE and TDUPDATE are missing, the calendar span cannot be calculated. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the zero editing time is impossible.  \n- **NTFS vs. DWG Timestamps**: No DWG timestamps are present; thus no comparison is possible.  \n- **$SI vs. $FN**: $FN creation time is unavailable; no comparison.  \n\n**Conclusion**: No timestamp contradictions or impossibilities can be established from the available data. The NTFS timestamps are internally consistent (creation equals modification) and exhibit normal nanosecond precision, indicating no evidence of timestomping in the NTFS metadata.\n\n---\n\n**5. INFORMATION LEAKAGE ANALYSIS**  \n\n- **Network Paths**: None detected.  \n- **Usernames / Author Fields**: Not specified.  \n- **FINGERPRINTGUID**: 30314341\u20113233\u20110000\u20110000\u2011000003c00100 \u2013 persists across saves and copies; identifies the original drawing.  \n- **VERSIONGUID**: 00003233\u20110000\u20110000\u201103c0\u201101000021001e \u2013 changes with each save; indicates the file has been saved at least once.  \n\nThe presence of a FINGERPRINTGUID confirms that the file was created by a CAD application that preserves this identifier (e.g., AutoCAD, LibreDWG). However, the absence of author or last\u2011saved\u2011by information and the lack of network paths provide no additional provenance data.\n\n---\n\n**6. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n\n| Evidence | What it **PROVES** | What it **INDICATES** | What remains **UNCERTAIN** |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| CRC mismatch | The file header was modified after the last legitimate AutoCAD (or compatible) save. | The file has been altered by a tool that did not recompute the CRC. | The nature of the alteration (intent, content changes) is unknown. |\n| Watermark absence | The file was **not** saved by a genuine Autodesk application, or the watermark was removed. | The file likely originates from a third\u2011party CAD program or has been tampered with to remove the watermark. | Whether the watermark was removed or never present cannot be determined without examining the file\u2019s internal structure. |\n| TDINDWG = 0.00\u202fh | No cumulative editing time recorded. | The file may have been created without any editing, or the TDINDWG variable was cleared or never set. | Without TDCREATE/TDUPDATE, we cannot assess whether the zero editing time is inconsistent with the file\u2019s age. |\n| NTFS timestamps | Creation and modification times are identical and internally consistent. | No evidence of NTFS timestomping. | The NTFS timestamps cannot be cross\u2011validated against DWG internal timestamps due to missing data. |\n| FINGERPRINTGUID & VERSIONGUID | The file contains standard CAD identifiers, indicating it was produced by a CAD application that preserves these GUIDs. | The file has undergone at least one legitimate save operation. | The specific application that created the file cannot be identified solely from these GUIDs. |\n\n**Overall Assessment**  \nThe forensic evidence **definitively proves** that the file header was altered after the last legitimate AutoCAD (or compatible) save, as evidenced by the CRC mismatch. It also **indicates with high confidence** that the file was not saved by a genuine Autodesk application (or that the watermark was removed), and that the cumulative editing time recorded is zero. No timestamp contradictions or NTFS timestomping are evident.\n\nHowever, the evidence **does not conclusively establish** the exact nature of the tampering, the content changes made, or the original authoring environment. Further investigation\u2014such as retrieving $FILE_NAME timestamps, examining the file\u2019s internal structure for watermark remnants, and analyzing the file\u2019s content for signs of modification\u2014would be required to fully ascertain the file\u2019s authenticity and provenance.",
