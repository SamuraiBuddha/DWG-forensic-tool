"A list of all other cases in which, during the PREVIOUS 4 YEARS, the witness
testified as an expert at trial or by deposition."

B. COURT SCRUTINY OF PRIOR TESTIMONY

Courts will examine:
- Frequency of testimony (too frequent may indicate "hired gun")
- Success rate (testimony admitted vs. excluded)
- Consistency of opinions across cases
- Relationship with retaining party (always plaintiff/always defendant)
- Subject matter consistency (digital forensics vs. unrelated fields)

C. OPTIMAL TESTIMONY RECORD

FREQUENCY:
- Moderate frequency preferred (2-6 cases per year)
- Too few: insufficient experience
- Too many (>10/year): "professional witness" perception

DIVERSITY:
- Mix of plaintiff and defense work
- Variety of case types (civil, criminal)
- Multiple law firms (not exclusive to one firm)
- Different jurisdictions (federal and state)

OUTCOMES:
- Testimony admitted in majority of cases
- Few or no Daubert/Frye exclusions
- Favorable case outcomes (not required, but strengthens credibility)

D. FIRST-TIME EXPERT WITNESSES

"The jury will determine whether someone is qualified to give testimony based
on the witness's CV and experience, and it would be ideal to work with someone
with past experience as a digital forensics expert witness, although an
impressive CV and years of field experience can make up for that."

STRATEGY FOR FIRST TESTIMONY:
1. Emphasize extensive practical experience (5+ years)
2. Highlight publications and certifications
3. Obtain mentorship from experienced expert witness
4. Consider testifying in lower-stakes case first
5. Prepare extensively with retaining counsel

E. HANDLING ADVERSE PRIOR TESTIMONY

If prior testimony was excluded or resulted in unfavorable outcome:
- Disclose proactively (opponent will discover regardless)
- Explain circumstances (e.g., insufficient data, new methodology)
- Demonstrate corrective measures taken
- Distinguish current case from prior excluded testimony

================================================================================
VI. CV STRUCTURE AND CONTENT
================================================================================

A. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE

"As a forensic expert, your CV is the most important document you will ever
have, serving as an integrity foundation - forensic experts must have
integrity."

================================================================================
VII. VOIR DIRE PREPARATION
================================================================================

A. VOIR DIRE PROCESS

Voir dire is the court proceeding where expert qualifications are established
before testimony is permitted.

TYPICAL VOIR DIRE QUESTIONS:
1. Please state your full name and occupation.
2. What is your educational background?
3. What professional certifications do you hold?
4. How many years of experience do you have in digital forensics?
5. Have you testified as an expert witness before? How many times?
6. What is your familiarity with [specific technology/methodology]?
7. Are you being compensated for your testimony today?

B. CREDIBILITY FACTORS COURTS ASSESS

EDUCATION:
- Relevant degrees from accredited institutions
- Advanced degrees in technical field

CERTIFICATIONS:
- Industry-recognized credentials (GCFE, CFCE, CCE)
- Current certifications (not expired)

EXPERIENCE:

RESPONSE: "While EnCE is specific to EnCase software, the underlying forensic
principles - chain of custody, hash verification, metadata analysis - are
universally applicable and align with NIST 800-86 guidelines."

CHALLENGE 2: "You have no specific experience with DWG files."
RESPONSE: "Digital forensic methodology is format-agnostic. I have examined
thousands of file types using binary analysis, metadata extraction, and
timeline reconstruction. DWG files are subject to the same forensic principles
I apply to all digital evidence."

CHALLENGE 3: "You testify exclusively for plaintiffs."
RESPONSE: "My testimony record includes work for both plaintiffs [X cases] and
defendants [Y cases]. My opinions are based on forensic findings, not party
affiliation."

CHALLENGE 4: "You are being paid for your testimony."
RESPONSE: "I am compensated for my time and expertise, not for the content of
my opinions. My hourly rate is $[X] for analysis and $[Y] for testimony, which
is consistent with industry standards. My opinions are based solely on forensic
evidence."

D. VOIR DIRE SUCCESS STRATEGIES

1. MEMORIZE CV: Know all dates, institutions, case names without referring to
   notes
2. SPEAK CLEARLY: Avoid technical jargon; explain complex concepts simply
