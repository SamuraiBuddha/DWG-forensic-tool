================================================================================
LEGAL FRAMEWORK MEMORANDUM
DWG/REVIT FORENSIC EVIDENCE ADMISSIBILITY
================================================================================

PREPARED FOR: Expert Witness Litigation Team
DATE: January 30, 2026
RE: Comprehensive Legal Standards for CAD/BIM File Forensic Evidence

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This memorandum analyzes the legal frameworks governing admissibility of
DWG/Revit forensic evidence in U.S. courts, focusing on Daubert and Frye
standards, digital evidence authentication, spoliation doctrines, and expert
witness qualification requirements. The analysis supports litigation strategy
for introducing computer-aided design (CAD) file forensics as admissible
scientific evidence.

KEY FINDINGS:
[1] Federal courts applying Daubert Standard (FRE 702) - Expert testimony
    requires demonstration of reliability, relevance, and proper methodology
[2] State courts split between Daubert and Frye - Jurisdictional analysis
    critical for forum selection
[3] 2023 FRE 702 Amendments - Heightened burden of proof (preponderance
    standard) now mandatory
[4] Digital evidence authentication - Hash values, metadata, and chain of
    custody documentation are essential
[5] Spoliation consequences - Adverse inferences available for intentional
    destruction of CAD files

================================================================================
I. DAUBERT STANDARD (FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 702)
================================================================================

A. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs expert testimony admissibility in federal
courts and many state jurisdictions. As amended December 1, 2023, the rule
provides:

    "A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,
    training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise
    if the proponent demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than not
    that:

    (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
        will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine
        a fact in issue;
    (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
    (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
    (d) the expert's opinion reflects a reliable application of the principles
        and methods to the facts of the case."

B. CRITICAL 2023 AMENDMENTS

The 2023 amendments to FRE 702 address widespread misapplication by courts:

1. PREPONDERANCE STANDARD: The proponent of expert testimony must demonstrate
   "to the court that it is more likely than not" that admissibility
   requirements are met.

2. SCOPE LIMITATION: Experts may not express conclusions that extend beyond
   what their methods can reliably support.

3. APPLICATION SCRUTINY: Courts must evaluate not only the expert's method
   but also how the method was applied in the specific case.

C. THE FOUR DAUBERT FACTORS

Courts apply a multi-factor test from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
509 U.S. 579 (1993):

FACTOR 1: TESTABILITY
- Can the theory or technique be tested?
- Has it been subjected to empirical testing?
- APPLICATION TO DWG FORENSICS: Binary parsing methods, CRC32 validation,
  timestamp extraction, and handle gap detection are all testable and
  reproducible procedures.

FACTOR 2: PEER REVIEW AND PUBLICATION
- Has the technique been subjected to peer review and publication?
- What is the quality and quantity of publications?
- APPLICATION TO DWG FORENSICS: AutoCAD DWG file format specifications, NIST
  SP 800-86 digital forensics guidelines, and ISO/IEC 27037:2012 provide peer-
  reviewed frameworks. Publication in digital forensics journals strengthens
  admissibility.

FACTOR 3: ERROR RATE
- What is the known or potential error rate?
- What standards and controls govern the technique?
- APPLICATION TO DWG FORENSICS: CRC32 checksums have quantifiable error rates;
  hash verification (SHA-256) has near-zero false positive rate; timestamp
  parsing accuracy depends on DWG version specification compliance.

FACTOR 4: GENERAL ACCEPTANCE
- Is the technique generally accepted in the relevant scientific community?
- APPLICATION TO DWG FORENSICS: File format forensics, binary header analysis,
  and digital chain of custody are widely accepted in digital forensics
  community per SWGDE (Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence) standards.

D. JUDICIAL GATEKEEPING ROLE

Under Daubert, trial judges serve as gatekeepers who must:
- Assess methodology reliability BEFORE admitting expert testimony
- Evaluate qualifications independently from methodology
- Consider relevance to specific facts of case
- Exclude testimony that is speculative or unsupported

IMPORTANT: Strong credentials alone are insufficient. A well-qualified expert
may still be excluded if methodology is unreliable or improperly applied.

SOURCE: FARO, Daubert in Detail
URL: https://www.faro.com/en/Resource-Library/Article/Daubert-in-Detail

E. DIGITAL FORENSICS UNDER DAUBERT

Digital forensics experts have successfully withstood Daubert challenges when:
1. Following NIST 800-86 guidelines for forensic procedures
2. Using validated forensic software with documented testing
3. Providing peer-reviewed publications supporting methodology
4. Demonstrating reproducibility and error rate quantification
5. Maintaining complete chain of custody documentation

CASE EXAMPLE: Computer Forensics Expert Withstands Daubert Challenge
An expert survived Daubert scrutiny by demonstrating expertise in computer
forensics investigation methodology, even when opponents challenged specific
application to information security protection.

SOURCE: Expert Institute, Computer Forensics Daubert Challenge
URL: https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/case-studies/computer-forensics-expert-witness-withstands-daubert-challenge/

F. WEAKNESSES OPPOSING EXPERTS MAY EXPLOIT

1. NOVEL METHODOLOGY: If DWG forensic techniques are presented as "novel"
   without established peer review, opponents may argue lack of general
   acceptance.

2. IMPROPER APPLICATION: Even valid methods can be excluded if applied
   incorrectly to case-specific facts (2023 amendment emphasis).

3. INSUFFICIENT DATA: If forensic analysis based on incomplete DWG file data
   or corrupted metadata, reliability may be challenged.

4. CONFLATING QUALIFICATIONS WITH METHODOLOGY: Opponent may concede expert
   qualifications while challenging whether specific methodology meets
   Daubert standards.

5. LACK OF TESTING: If expert did not perform validation testing or cannot
   articulate error rates, testimony may be excluded.

DEFENSE STRATEGY:
- Preemptively provide peer-reviewed literature (NIST, ISO, SWGDE)
- Demonstrate testing/validation performed on DWG parsing tools
- Quantify error rates for each forensic technique
- Show general acceptance through industry standards (AutoCAD specifications)
- Document complete methodology in expert report per FRCP 26

================================================================================
II. FRYE STANDARD (STATE COURTS)
================================================================================

A. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The Frye standard originates from Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.
Cir. 1923), which provides:

    "Expert opinion based on a scientific technique is admissible only when
    the technique is generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific
    community."

Frye applies a SINGLE TEST: general acceptance in the scientific community.

SOURCE: Wikipedia, Frye Standard
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frye_standard

B. JURISDICTIONAL SPLIT (2026)

States still following Frye include:
- California (modified post-2012 to resemble Daubert)
- Illinois
- Minnesota (Frye-Mack for novel scientific evidence)
- New York
- Pennsylvania
- Washington

SOURCE: Forensisgroup, Daubert vs. Frye State-by-State Guide 2025
URL: https://www.forensisgroup.com/resources/expert-legal-witness-blog/daubert-vs-frye-a-state-by-state-guide-for-expert-witness-admissibility-in-2025

C. DAUBERT VS. FRYE COMPARISON

CRITERIA              | DAUBERT                  | FRYE
----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------
Test                  | Multi-factor reliability | General acceptance only
Flexibility           | Flexible, case-specific  | Rigid, community consensus
Error Rate            | Required consideration   | Not explicitly required
Peer Review           | Encouraged but not req.  | Implicit in "acceptance"
Judicial Discretion   | High (gatekeeping)       | Lower (deference to field)
Novel Techniques      | May be admitted if valid | Must wait for acceptance

D. FRYE APPLICATION TO DWG FORENSICS

FAVORABLE FACTORS:
1. Binary file format analysis is generally accepted in digital forensics
2. Hash verification (SHA-256, MD5) universally accepted for integrity
3. Metadata extraction standard practice in computer forensics
4. NIST and ISO standards confer "general acceptance"

UNFAVORABLE FACTORS:
1. CAD-specific forensics is niche; fewer publications than general digital
   forensics
2. Novel techniques (e.g., LLM-enhanced red herring filtering) may not yet
   be "generally accepted"
3. DWG binary parsing less established than standard file formats (JPEG, PDF)

LITIGATION STRATEGY:
- Emphasize alignment with NIST 800-86 and ISO/IEC 27037:2012
- Cite general acceptance of underlying techniques (binary parsing, CRC
  validation, timestamp analysis)
- Distinguish "novel application" from "novel technique" - applying accepted
  methods to DWG files should satisfy Frye
- Obtain declarations from digital forensics experts confirming general
  acceptance

E. CALIFORNIA MODIFICATION

California nominally follows Frye but post-Sargon Enterprises, Inc. v.
University of Southern California (2012), courts apply a Daubert-like analysis:
- Reliability of expert's reasoning, not just general acceptance
- Closer scrutiny of methodology and application
- Rejection of "net opinion" (conclusory statements without foundation)

PRACTICAL IMPACT: California litigation should prepare for Daubert-level
scrutiny even though state technically follows Frye.

================================================================================
III. FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE: AUTHENTICATION AND BEST EVIDENCE
================================================================================

A. FRE 901: AUTHENTICATION

Federal Rule of Evidence 901 requires authentication before evidence is
admissible:

    Rule 901(a): "To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying
    an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to
    support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is."

AUTHENTICATION STANDARD: Prima facie showing - reasonable juror could conclude
the evidence is what proponent claims.

SOURCE: Cornell Law School, Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 901
URL: https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_901

B. AUTHENTICATION METHODS FOR DIGITAL EVIDENCE

Rule 901(b) provides non-exclusive authentication methods:

METHOD 1: TESTIMONY OF WITNESS WITH KNOWLEDGE (Rule 901(b)(1))
- Forensic examiner testifies to chain of custody
- Creator of DWG file testifies to authenticity
- IT administrator testifies to file storage/retrieval

METHOD 2: DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS (Rule 901(b)(4))
- Metadata (creation date, author, application version)
- File structure signatures (DWG header: "AC1032" for AutoCAD 2018+)
- Internal consistency (CRC32 checksums, handle sequences)

METHOD 3: PROCESS OR SYSTEM (Rule 901(b)(9))
- Automated process that produces accurate result
- Example: Hash value generation, forensic imaging software
- Requires showing system reliability and proper operation

SOURCE: PageVault, Web Evidence Authentication FRE 901 and 902
URL: https://blog.page-vault.com/establishing-authenticity-esi-fre

C. DIGITAL FORENSIC AUTHENTICATION TECHNIQUES

HASH VALUES:
- SHA-256, MD5 create unique numerical identifiers for files
- Hash verification proves file integrity (unaltered since acquisition)
- General acceptance: universally used in digital forensics

METADATA:
- Embedded creation date, modification date, author, application info
- DWG files contain: TDCREATE, TDUPDATE, TDINDWG, version strings
- Metadata changes can indicate tampering

FILE SIGNATURES:
- DWG header at offset 0x00: version string (e.g., "AC1032")
- CRC32 checksum at offset 0x68 (R18+ versions)
- Binary structure validation confirms file type authenticity

CHAIN OF CUSTODY:
- Document every person who handled evidence
- Log all forensic operations performed
- Demonstrate no alteration opportunity

SOURCE: Judge Paul W. Grimm, Best Practices for Authenticating Digital Evidence
URL: https://jhany.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/authenticatingdigitalevidence.pdf

D. LORRAINE V. MARKEL: LANDMARK AUTHENTICATION CASE

Lorraine v. Markel American Insurance Co., 241 F.R.D. 534 (D. Md. 2007)
provided comprehensive guidance on ESI authentication:

KEY HOLDINGS:
1. Metadata is a "distinctive characteristic" under Rule 901(b)(4)
2. Hash values provide authentication through unique numerical identifiers
3. Native format preservation (including metadata) strengthens authentication
4. Court described as "godfather of all cases" for electronic evidence

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
- Preserve DWG files in native format with metadata intact
- Generate hash values at time of acquisition
- Document forensic process to establish Rule 901(b)(9) reliability
- Expert testimony on hash verification satisfies authentication burden

SOURCE: Wikipedia, Lorraine v. Markel American Insurance Co.
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_v._Markel_American_Insurance_Co.

E. FRE 902: SELF-AUTHENTICATION

Rule 902 allows certain evidence to be admitted without extrinsic foundation:

Rule 902(13): CERTIFIED RECORDS GENERATED BY ELECTRONIC PROCESS
- Records generated by electronic process/system that produces accurate result
- Certification by qualified person stating process reliability
- Opponent must give advance notice to challenge

Rule 902(14): CERTIFIED DATA COPIED FROM ELECTRONIC DEVICE
- Data copied from electronic device, storage medium, or file
- Certification by qualified person using process to produce accurate results
- Reduces need for live testimony to authenticate ESI

PRACTICAL BENEFIT: Expert can provide certification instead of live testimony
for authentication, though opponents may still challenge on other grounds.

URL: https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902

F. BEST EVIDENCE RULE (FRE 1001-1008)

Rule 1002: "An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order
to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides
otherwise."

FRE 1001 DEFINITIONS FOR DIGITAL EVIDENCE:

"ORIGINAL" for Electronic Records:
- Any printout or output readable by sight if it accurately reflects the
  information
- PRACTICAL IMPACT: DWG file copy on forensic workstation = "original"

"DUPLICATE":
- Counterpart produced by electronic or equivalent process that accurately
  reproduces original
- PRACTICAL IMPACT: Forensically imaged DWG file = admissible duplicate

Rule 1003: ADMISSIBILITY OF DUPLICATES
- Duplicate admissible to same extent as original UNLESS:
  (1) Genuine question about original's authenticity, OR
  (2) Unfair to admit duplicate instead of original

PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO DWG FORENSICS:
- Forensic copies of DWG files are admissible as "originals"
- Hash-verified duplicates satisfy authentication requirements
- No need to produce original DWG file from source system if forensic copy
  properly authenticated
- Opposing party must raise "genuine question" about authenticity to exclude
  duplicate

IV. DIGITAL FORENSICS STANDARDS
================================================================================

A. NIST SP 800-86: GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES

OVERVIEW:
NIST Special Publication 800-86 provides practical guidance on performing
computer and network forensics. While aimed at IT operations, the framework
supports legal admissibility.

FOUR-STEP FORENSIC PROCESS:
1. COLLECTION: Identify, label, record, and acquire data from all relevant
   sources using procedures that preserve integrity
2. EXAMINATION: Process collected data to extract relevant information
3. ANALYSIS: Analyze results to derive conclusions addressing investigation
   questions
4. REPORTING: Report findings in clear, complete format

LEGAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Expert testimony credibility enhanced by NIST compliance
- Repeatable and defendable methodology
- Documentation supports chain of custody
- Legal advisors should review forensic policies

SOURCE: NIST, Special Publication 800-86
URL: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/86/final

EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY:
"If the results of an investigation are used in a court of law, incident
handlers may be called upon to provide testimony and corroborate their
findings."

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
NIST guidelines ensure examiners follow same workflow so work is documented,
results can be repeated (repeatable), and defended (defendable).

B. ISO/IEC 27037:2012: DIGITAL EVIDENCE GUIDELINES

SCOPE:
ISO/IEC 27037:2012 provides guidelines for identification, collection,
acquisition, and preservation of digital evidence with evidential value.

PURPOSE:
Establish principles and requirements for ensuring integrity, authenticity,
and reliability of potential digital evidence from discovery until court
presentation.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Digital Evidence First Responders (DEFRs)
- Digital Evidence Specialists (DESs)
- Incident response specialists
- Forensic laboratory managers
- ALL may serve as expert witnesses

LEGAL ADMISSIBILITY:
"For cyber lawyers representing clients who need to present digital evidence,
understanding ISO 27037 is essential for ensuring its admissibility."

Working with digital forensics experts who follow ISO 27037 guidelines helps
ensure evidence is collected, preserved, and handled according to
internationally recognized standards.

SOURCE: SWGDE, Best Practices for Computer Forensic Examination
URL: https://www.swgde.org/documents/published-complete-listing/18-f-001-swgde-best-practices-for-computer-forensic-examination/

D. INTEGRATION WITH DAUBERT STANDARD

NIST/ISO/SWGDE standards support Daubert factors:

TESTABILITY: Standards require validation and testing of forensic methods
PEER REVIEW: Standards developed through community consensus (peer review)
ERROR RATE: Quality assurance protocols document error rates
GENERAL ACCEPTANCE: Widespread adoption in digital forensics community

LITIGATION STRATEGY:
Expert witness testimony should explicitly cite NIST, ISO, and SWGDE compliance
to establish:
1. Reliability of methodology (Daubert Factor 1)
2. Peer review and publication (Daubert Factor 2)
3. Standards and controls (Daubert Factor 3)
4. General acceptance (Daubert Factor 4)

================================================================================
V. SPOLIATION OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE
================================================================================

A. SPOLIATION DEFINED

Spoliation is the destruction, alteration, or concealment of evidence relevant
to litigation. In digital context, spoliation includes:
- Deletion of CAD/DWG files
- Overwriting metadata
- Failure to preserve backup copies
- Destruction of journal files or audit logs

B. LEGAL DUTY TO PRESERVE

Courts impose a duty to preserve evidence when litigation is reasonably
foreseeable. This duty arises:
- When lawsuit is filed
- When litigation is threatened
- When party has reasonable anticipation of litigation

PRACTICAL TRIGGER: Demand letter, cease-and-desist, or dispute escalation
creates preservation duty.

C. FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 37(e)

Rule 37(e) governs sanctions for failure to preserve electronically stored
information (ESI):

Rule 37(e): "If electronically stored information that should have been
preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party
failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or
replaced through additional discovery, the court:

(1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may
    order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or

(2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another
    party of the information's use in the litigation may:
    (A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;
    (B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was
        unfavorable to the party; or
    (C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment."

SOURCE: Duke Law, Rule 37(e): The New Law of Electronic Spoliation
URL: https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/rule-37e-the-new-law-of-electronic-spoliation/

D. REQUIREMENTS FOR SANCTIONS

THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT: Party "failed to take reasonable steps to preserve" ESI

FOR CURATIVE MEASURES (Rule 37(e)(1)):
- Prejudice to opposing party from information loss
- Measures no greater than necessary to cure prejudice

FOR ADVERSE INFERENCE (Rule 37(e)(2)):
- INTENT to deprive opposing party of information's use in litigation
- Higher standard than negligence
- Subjective test requiring bad faith

IMPORTANT: Negligent destruction may warrant sanctions, but adverse inference
requires intentional conduct.

E. 2025 FEDERAL CASE LAW UPDATE

National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cummins Inc., 2025 WL
2532528 (S.D. Ind. Sept. 3, 2025):

HOLDING: Federal court applying Indiana law allowed intentional spoliation
counterclaim to proceed where concrete litigation costs and prejudice alleged.

SIGNIFICANCE: Federal courts increasingly willing to recognize spoliation
claims when party demonstrates:
1. Intentional destruction of evidence
2. Concrete prejudice (not speculative harm)
3. Quantifiable litigation costs from evidence loss

SOURCE: Digital Warroom, What Is Spoliation Of Evidence?
URL: https://www.digitalwarroom.com/blog/what-is-digital-spoliation

F. STATE-SPECIFIC SPOLIATION STANDARDS

CALIFORNIA:
- First state to recognize independent tort of spoliation
- Elements: (1) pending/probable litigation; (2) defendant's knowledge;
  (3) intentional spoliation acts; (4) disruption of case; (5) damages
- LIMITATION: California Supreme Court (1998) held spoliation not cognizable
  against party-defendant if discovered before trial
- REMEDIES: Adverse inference jury instructions, monetary sanctions,
  evidentiary sanctions

SOURCE: California Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) No. 204
URL: https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/200/204/

ILLINOIS:
- Duty to preserve relevant evidence applies even before lawsuit filed
- REMEDIES: (1) Dismissal under Rule 219(c); (2) Negligent spoliation claim;
  (3) Adverse inference instructions; (4) Bar specific claims/defenses

SOURCE: Illinois State Bar Association, Sanctions and Spoliation
URL: https://www.isba.org/sections/civilpractice/newsletter/2011/08/sanctionsandspoliation

PENNSYLVANIA:
- No separate tort for negligent spoliation (unlike other jurisdictions)
- Duty to preserve evidence in care, custody, or control
- Court considers: (1) degree of fault; (2) prejudice to opponent;
  (3) availability of lesser sanctions

SOURCE: Pittsburgh Litigation Lawyer, Spoliation in PA
URL: https://pittsburgh-litigation-lawyer.com/duty-to-preserve-evidence-spoliation-in-pa/

NEW YORK:
- Follows Frye standard for expert testimony
- Spoliation sanctions available for willful/negligent destruction
- "Willful suppression" instruction available for intentional concealment

G. APPLICATION TO CAD/DWG FILES

SPOLIATION SCENARIOS:
1. Deletion of original DWG files after receiving demand letter
2. Overwriting NTFS timestamps to conceal creation/modification dates
3. Destroying Revit journal files (.txt logs documenting all user actions)
4. Reformatting hard drives containing backup CAD files
5. Failing to preserve cloud-synced versions (BIM 360, AutoCAD Drive)

ADVERSE INFERENCE ARGUMENT:
"The absence of Revit journal files, which AutoCAD automatically creates and
preserves, combined with NTFS timestamp anomalies showing file modification
after litigation notice, supports a presumption that Defendant intentionally
destroyed evidence unfavorable to its case."

DEFENSE AGAINST SPOLIATION CLAIMS:
- Implement litigation hold immediately upon dispute
- Document preservation efforts (legal hold notices to employees)
- Preserve native CAD files with metadata intact
- Create forensic images of relevant systems
- Retain IT audit logs showing file access/deletion

H. CONSTRUCTION LITIGATION CONTEXT

"As a general rule, a party has a duty to take reasonable steps to preserve
evidence that is or may be relevant to foreseeable litigation."

CONSTRUCTION-SPECIFIC ISSUES:
- Repair/reconstruction of work in place may constitute spoliation
- Spoliation sanctions not automatic - inquiry depends on:
  (1) Notice of duty to preserve
  (2) Availability of evidence from other sources
  (3) Presence of bad faith

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE: Even if physical evidence lost, spoliation sanctions may
be avoided if party acted in good faith, gave notice, and alternative evidence
exists (e.g., DWG files, photographs, inspection reports).

================================================================================
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND LITIGATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

A. DAUBERT/FRYE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

[X] TESTABILITY: Document testing procedures for DWG parsing, CRC validation
[X] PEER REVIEW: Cite NIST 800-86, ISO 27037, SWGDE standards, AutoCAD specs
[X] ERROR RATE: Quantify CRC32 collision rates, hash verification accuracy
[X] GENERAL ACCEPTANCE: Show digital forensics community acceptance
[X] METHODOLOGY: Prepare detailed written methodology for expert report
[X] RELIABILITY: Demonstrate validation of forensic software tools
[X] RELEVANT APPLICATION: Show methodology properly applied to case facts

B. AUTHENTICATION CHECKLIST

[X] CHAIN OF CUSTODY: Document every person who handled DWG files
[X] HASH VALUES: Generate SHA-256 hashes at acquisition, verify at analysis
[X] METADATA PRESERVATION: Maintain native format with timestamps intact
[X] FORENSIC IMAGING: Create bit-for-bit copies using validated tools
[X] DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS: Identify DWG version strings, CRC checksums

[X] JOURNAL FILES: Retain Revit .txt journals documenting user actions
[X] NTFS TIMESTAMPS: Avoid any file operations that alter metadata
[X] DOCUMENTATION: Log all preservation efforts for court submission

D. JURISDICTION SELECTION STRATEGY

FEDERAL COURT (DAUBERT):
ADVANTAGES:
- More predictable standards (FRE 702)
- Recent 2023 amendments favor rigorous methodology
- Nationwide consistency in application
- Self-authentication under FRE 902 available

DISADVANTAGES:
- Higher burden of proof (preponderance standard)
- Judicial gatekeeping more stringent
- Opponents may file Daubert motion to exclude

STATE COURT (VARIES BY STATE):
FRYE STATES (CA, IL, NY, PA, WA):
- Lower barrier: "general acceptance" easier than multi-factor Daubert
- Emphasize alignment with NIST/ISO standards
- Novel techniques may struggle without widespread acceptance

DAUBERT STATES (MAJORITY):
- Similar to federal analysis
- May have state-specific modifications

RECOMMENDATION: If DWG forensics methodology is well-established with peer-
reviewed publications, federal court (Daubert) preferable for nationwide
enforceability and FRE 902 self-authentication benefits.

If methodology is novel or cutting-edge (e.g., LLM-enhanced analysis), Frye
state may be preferable to avoid multi-factor Daubert scrutiny.

E. EXPERT REPORT TIMING (FRCP 26)

INITIAL DISCLOSURE: At least 90 days before trial
REBUTTAL DISCLOSURE: Within 30 days after opponent's disclosure

EXPERT REPORT MUST INCLUDE (FRCP 26(a)(2)(B)):
1. Complete statement of all opinions and basis/reasons
2. Facts or data considered in forming opinions
3. Exhibits to summarize or support opinions
4. Expert's qualifications and publications (last 10 years)
5. List of cases with expert testimony (last 4 years)
6. Statement of compensation

CRITICAL: Expert report is foundation for Daubert challenge defense. Must
demonstrate methodology, data sufficiency, and reliable application.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

DWG/Revit forensic evidence is admissible in federal and state courts if expert
testimony satisfies Daubert or Frye standards, evidence is properly
authenticated under FRE 901, and chain of custody is maintained per NIST/ISO/
SWGDE guidelines.

The 2023 FRE 702 amendments heighten the burden on expert proponents to
demonstrate reliability by preponderance of evidence. Successful litigation
requires:
1. Peer-reviewed methodology aligned with NIST 800-86 and ISO 27037
2. Quantified error rates and validation testing
3. Complete chain of custody documentation with hash verification
4. Compliance with spoliation preservation duties
5. Comprehensive expert report per FRCP 26

Opposing counsel will likely challenge methodology application rather than
expert qualifications. Defense requires demonstrating that forensic techniques
were properly applied to case-specific facts and that conclusions are supported
by sufficient data.
