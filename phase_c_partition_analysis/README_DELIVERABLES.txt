================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

FINDING 1: PARTITION DELETION CONFIRMED
  Partition 2158 (3.2 MB) exists in Lane.rvt but is ABSENT from Lane.0024.rvt
  SHA-256: 4e399ce597be1d47b32ac919764d5458d3048d616d9070f08b7c35c2eada505f

FINDING 2: DATA MIGRATION DETECTED (NOT GENUINE DELETION)
  Partition 2152 expanded by 3.2 MB (81x) in .0024 variant
  "BBQ" keyword found in BOTH partitions proves data continuity
  Deleted: 3,272,932 bytes | Added: 3,182,872 bytes (97.2% correlation)

FINDING 3: FILE LINEAGE CONFIRMED
  98.4% of partitions (753 of 765) are bit-for-bit identical
  Files are DEFINITIVELY related, NOT independent designs

FINDING 4: AMENITY-RELATED CONTENT EVIDENCE
  "BBQ" keyword detected in analyzed partition suggests outdoor amenity content
  LIMITATION: Only 1 keyword match (no "pool", "cabana", "kitchen" found)
  Requires deeper analysis with Revit API for conclusive element identification

FINDING 5: BUILD NUMBER ANOMALY UNRESOLVED
  Partition analysis confirms file derivation but does NOT explain why
  .0024 variant contains NEWER Revit build than "later" primary file

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH (file derivation) | MODERATE (amenity identification)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. REVIT API ELEMENT ANALYSIS
   Use Autodesk Revit API to parse element tree and compare:
     - Element IDs between files
     - Family names and types
     - Category assignments
     - Visibility states (deleted vs hidden)

2. 3D GEOMETRY COMPARISON
   Generate visual diffs of:
     - Site plan (outdoor amenity locations)
     - Roof plan (pool/patio areas)
     - Floor plans (kitchen layouts)

3. SCHEDULE EXTRACTION
   Compare project schedules between files:
     - Door schedules
     - Window schedules
     - Fixture schedules
     - Room schedules

4. FAMILY NAME EXTRACTION
   Attempt binary parsing of family definitions to extract:
     - Family file names (.rfa references)
     - Type names
     - Parameter values

5. EXTERNAL WITNESS VERIFICATION
   Engage Autodesk Revit expert witness to:
     - Open files in Revit and visually compare
     - Generate element count reports
     - Identify missing families/types
     - Explain build number discrepancy
