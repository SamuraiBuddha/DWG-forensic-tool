SECTION 2: ACQUISITION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

2.1 INITIAL RECEIPT OF EVIDENCE

Date Received: [Date client provided original files]
Received From: [Client name and contact information]
Transfer Method: [Secure file transfer | Physical media | Email | Cloud link]
Receipt Documentation: [Email confirmation | Signed transfer form]

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON RECEIPT:
1. Verified file integrity (files open correctly in Autodesk Revit)
2. Calculated SHA-256 cryptographic hashes of original files
3. Documented file metadata (size, creation date, modification date)
4. Created isolated storage directory on write-protected media
5. Generated chain of custody log entry

2.2 FORENSIC COPY CREATION

Tool Used: FTK Imager v4.7 (AccessData/Exterro)
- Industry-standard forensic imaging tool
- Write-blocking capability ensures no modification of source files
- Generates cryptographic hashes for verification

Procedure:
1. Connected source media containing original files via USB write-blocker
2. Launched FTK Imager with administrator privileges
3. Selected "Create Disk Image" function
4. Specified source files: Lane.rvt and Lane.0024
5. Configured destination: Write-protected forensic drive
6. Selected hash algorithm: SHA-256 (256-bit cryptographic hash)
7. Initiated imaging process with automatic hash calculation
8. Verified completion without errors
9. Compared source hash to destination hash (must match exactly)
10. Documented results in forensic acquisition log

Write-Blocking Technology:
- Hardware write-blocker: [Model and serial number]
- Purpose: Prevents any write operations to source media
- Verification: Device tested before acquisition to confirm write-blocking
- Result: No modifications to original files during acquisition

2.3 HASH VERIFICATION

SHA-256 Hash Algorithm:
- 256-bit cryptographic hash function (SHA-2 family)
- Produces unique "fingerprint" for each file
- Probability of hash collision: 1 in 2^256 (effectively impossible)
- Any change to file (even 1 bit) produces completely different hash
- Industry standard for digital evidence integrity verification

Hash Calculation Process:
1. FTK Imager calculated SHA-256 hash of original files during acquisition
2. FTK Imager calculated SHA-256 hash of forensic copies after creation
3. Manual verification using Windows CertUtil command:
   certutil -hashfile "C:\Path\To\File.rvt" SHA256
4. Cross-verification using ExifTool SHA-256 calculation
5. All four hash values compared (FTK original, FTK copy, CertUtil, ExifTool)
6. Result: All hashes match exactly, confirming perfect forensic copy

LANE.RVT HASH VERIFICATION:
- FTK Imager (Original): [Hash to be inserted]
- FTK Imager (Copy): [Hash to be inserted - must match]
- CertUtil Verification: [Hash to be inserted - must match]
- ExifTool Verification: [Hash to be inserted - must match]
- STATUS: VERIFIED [All hashes match] / NOT VERIFIED [Discrepancy detected]

LANE.0024 HASH VERIFICATION:
- FTK Imager (Original): [Hash to be inserted]
- FTK Imager (Copy): [Hash to be inserted - must match]
- CertUtil Verification: [Hash to be inserted - must match]
- ExifTool Verification: [Hash to be inserted - must match]
- STATUS: VERIFIED [All hashes match] / NOT VERIFIED [Discrepancy detected]

After creating verified forensic copies, write-protection was implemented:

STORAGE MEDIA:
- Media Type: External SSD forensic drive
- Model: [Drive manufacturer and model]
- Serial Number: [Drive serial number]
- Capacity: [Drive capacity]

WRITE-PROTECTION METHOD:

- File system permissions set to read-only
- Forensic copies stored in read-only directory
- Directory permissions: Administrator read-only, no write, no delete

VERIFICATION:

- File properties confirmed as read-only
- SHA-256 hashes re-calculated after write-protection to confirm no changes

PHYSICAL SECURITY:
- Drive stored in locked evidence cabinet
- Access restricted to forensic examiner and authorized legal team
