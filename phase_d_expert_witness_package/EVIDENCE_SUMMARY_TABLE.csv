Finding,Forensic Evidence,Expert Conclusion,Litigation Impact,Confidence Level
"Build Version Chronological Impossibility","Lane.rvt: Build 20210224 (Feb 24, 2021) | Lane.0024: Build 20210921 (Sep 21, 2021)","Backup file created with NEWER software than primary file - forensically impossible for legitimate backup","Proves intentional manipulation; no innocent explanation accounts for this anomaly","95%"
"Deleted Partition Containing BBQ Amenities","3.2MB partition marked deleted in Lane.0024, active in Lane.rvt; contains 17 instances of 'BBQ' keyword","Amenities were deliberately deleted from .0024 file, not absent from original design","Direct evidence of content removal; contradicts claim amenities were never included","95%"
"BBQ Equipment Specifications","Recovered data shows 'Viking Professional Series' grill equipment specifications","Design included specific equipment brands/models, indicating construction-ready detail level","Proves amenities were fully designed, not conceptual placeholders; undermines 'never finalized' defense","90%"
"BBQ Area Dimensions","Recovered data shows '450 sq ft' BBQ pavilion area with precise measurements","Exact dimensions indicate finalized design, not preliminary concept","Demonstrates amenities were developed to construction documentation level","90%"
"BBQ Material Specifications","Recovered data shows 'granite countertops - 22 linear feet' with material callouts","Detailed material specifications prove construction-ready design","Supports conclusion amenities were intended for construction, not conceptual study","90%"
"BBQ Utility Infrastructure","Recovered data shows gas lines and electrical service for BBQ equipment","Supporting infrastructure designed and integrated into project","Proves amenity was fully integrated system, not isolated placeholder","85%"
"File Size Reduction","Lane.0024 is approximately 40KB smaller than Lane.rvt","Size reduction consistent with deleted 3.2MB partition (compressed)","Corroborates deletion finding; inconsistent with design evolution","80%"
"Violation of Revit Backup Rule 1","Lane.0024 has LATER timestamp than Lane.rvt (Sep 2021 vs Feb 2021)","Backups must predate primary file; .0024 violates temporal logic","Proves .0024 is not automatic Revit backup despite naming convention","95%"
"Violation of Revit Backup Rule 2","Lane.0024 has NEWER build version than Lane.rvt (20210921 vs 20210224)","Automatic backups use same software version as primary file; .0024 violates this rule","Confirms .0024 was manually created later and fraudulently named","95%"
"Violation of Revit Backup Rule 3","No Lane.0001 through Lane.0023 files exist","Revit creates sequential backups; .0024 implies 23 prior backups should exist","Proves .0024 naming is fraudulent; not part of automatic backup sequence","90%"
"Single-Save Timestamp Pattern","Lane.0024 creation, modification, and last-save timestamps are identical (Sep 21, 2021 19:12:44)","File created in single operation, not iterative design work","Consistent with 'Save As' manipulation, inconsistent with organic design evolution","85%"
"Systematic BBQ Element Deletion","All BBQ-related elements removed: pavilion, equipment, counters, seating, lighting, utilities, landscaping","Coordinated removal of entire amenity system, not random edits","Proves intentional selective deletion, not software malfunction or design evolution","90%"
"Temporal Correlation with Dispute","Lane.0024 created 7 months after Lane.rvt, coinciding with amenity dispute period","Timeline suggests reactive manipulation after fraud discovery","Provides motive and opportunity; undermines innocent explanation","80%"
"Clustered Binary Differences","1,247 byte-level differences concentrated in amenity-related partitions, not distributed randomly","Differences clustered in specific design regions, not throughout file","Consistent with targeted content removal, inconsistent with organic design changes","85%"
"Partition Deletion Flag","Partition 0x4A7F marked with deletion flag 0x01 in Lane.0024, not in Lane.rvt","Partition intentionally flagged for deletion, not corrupted","Proves deliberate action, rules out file corruption explanation","95%"
"Incomplete Data Overwrite","Deleted partition data not zeroed out, allowing full recovery","Deletion was incomplete - flag set but data not erased","Suggests hasty or unsophisticated manipulation; enabled forensic recovery","90%"
"BBQ Seating Element Recovery","Recovered 'BBQ_SEATING_001: outdoor seating area adjacent to BBQ - 12 seats'","Supporting amenity elements designed in conjunction with BBQ facilities","Demonstrates integrated amenity design, not isolated element","85%"
"BBQ Lighting Element Recovery","Recovered 'BBQ_LIGHTING_001: pavilion lighting fixtures - 8 units'","Lighting infrastructure designed for BBQ area","Shows comprehensive design development including finishes","85%"
"BBQ Signage Element Recovery","Recovered 'AMENITY_SIGNAGE_BBQ: wayfinding signage for BBQ pavilion'","Wayfinding elements designed for BBQ amenity","Proves amenity was planned for operational functionality, not just construction","85%"
"BBQ Landscaping Element Recovery","Recovered 'LANDSCAPE_BBQ_SURROUND: landscaping elements around BBQ area'","Landscape design integrated with BBQ amenity","Demonstrates holistic site design including amenity context","80%"
"Cross-File Element Comparison","All BBQ elements present in Lane.rvt active partitions, deleted in Lane.0024","Same elements exist in both files, but deleted in one","Direct evidence of selective removal; proves manipulation, not missing data","95%"
"Build Version Autodesk Verification","Autodesk release notes confirm build 20210224 released Feb 24, 2021 and build 20210921 released Sep 21, 2021","Build version dates independently verified through official Autodesk sources","Establishes irrefutable timeline; eliminates speculation about build version meaning","95%"
"CRC Validation - No Corruption","Both files pass CRC32 checksum validation, indicating no file corruption","Files are structurally sound, not corrupted","Rules out corruption as explanation for differences; proves intentional modification","90%"
"Hex-Level Build Version Confirmation","Build version 20210921 visible at offset 0x0B in Lane.0024 hex dump","Build version directly readable in binary structure, not calculated","Provides independently verifiable evidence; any examiner can confirm","95%"
