    Autodesk-certified professionals to validate my methodology."

---

Q6 (Direct): "Are you being compensated for your testimony today?"

A: "Yes. I am being compensated at my standard hourly rate of $[amount] per hour
    for my time, including analysis, report preparation, and testimony. My
    compensation is the same regardless of my conclusions or the outcome of this
    case. I am paid for my time and expertise, not for any particular opinion."

JURY NOTE: Establish transparency and objectivity regarding compensation

---

Q7 (Direct): "Do you follow any recognized standards in your forensic work?"

A: "Yes. All of my forensic analysis follows established standards including
    NIST Special Publication 800-86 for digital evidence handling, ISO 27037

QUALIFICATION SUMMARY FOR JURY:
"Ladies and gentlemen, before we proceed, let me summarize why I'm qualified to
 testify in this matter. I have [X] years of experience in digital forensics,
 specific expertise in CAD and BIM file analysis, and I follow the same
 internationally recognized standards used by the FBI and other forensic
 laboratories. My findings are based on objective scientific methodology, not
 advocacy for either party."

OPPOSING COUNSEL OBJECTION LIKELY: "Your Honor, we object to the qualification
of this witness under Daubert. The witness has admitted to using custom-built
software not peer-reviewed by the scientific community."

RESPONSE (by retaining attorney):
"Your Honor, the witness has explained that the custom tool was validated against
widely accepted open-source parsers and that all findings were independently
verified using multiple forensic tools. The methodology, not the specific tool,
is what must be scientifically valid under Daubert. The witness follows NIST
and ISO standards, which are universally accepted in federal courts."

COURT RULING (anticipated): "Objection overruled. The Court finds the witness
qualified to testify as an expert in digital forensics. The jury will determine
the weight to give the testimony. Proceed."

================================================================================
PHASE 2: DIRECT EXAMINATION - OPENING STATEMENT
================================================================================

Q8 (Direct): "What were you asked to do in this case?"

A: "I was asked to conduct a forensic examination of two Autodesk Revit files:
    'Lane.rvt' and 'Lane.0024'. Specifically, I was asked to determine whether
    these files were authentic design documents, whether they had been altered,
    and what the timeline of their creation was."

---

Q9 (Direct): "Can you summarize your conclusions in plain language for the jury?"

A: "Yes. After extensive forensic analysis, I concluded that the file named
    'Lane.0024' - which was presented as an earlier or original version of the
    design - was actually created AFTER the file 'Lane.rvt' using newer software.
    Someone took the newer file, removed specific amenity features including BBQ
    facilities, and saved it with a name designed to make it look like an older
    backup file. The forensic evidence proves this file is not what it appears
    to be."

VISUAL AID: Display simple timeline showing Lane.rvt (Feb 2021) and Lane.0024

JURY IMPACT: This opening statement establishes the "smoking gun" conclusion
immediately, framing the rest of testimony around proving this central claim.

---

Q10 (Direct): "That's a serious allegation. How confident are you in this
              conclusion?"

A: "I am 95% confident in this conclusion, which is the scientific standard for
    high certainty. This is the same confidence level used in medical diagnoses,
    engineering safety analyses, and forensic DNA evidence. It means the
    evidence is overwhelming and the conclusion is as certain as scientific
    analysis can make it."

---

Q11 (Direct): "What is the basis for your 95% confidence?"

A: "Three independent lines of evidence all point to the same conclusion:

    First, the build version analysis. The .0024 file was created with a version
    of Revit software released in September 2021, while Lane.rvt was created
    with a version from February 2021. A backup cannot be created with newer
    software than the file it's backing up.

    Second, the deleted partition. I recovered a 3.2-megabyte partition from the
    .0024 file that had been deliberately deleted. This partition contained
    detailed specifications for BBQ amenities that were present in Lane.rvt but
    removed from the .0024 version.

    Third, the violation of Revit's backup rules. Revit automatically creates
    backups with sequential numbers. The .0024 file violates every rule of how
    Revit backups work - wrong timeline, wrong software version, missing
    intermediate backups.

    When three independent forensic methods all reach the same conclusion, that's
    why I can state 95% confidence."

independent analyses

================================================================================
PHASE 2: DIRECT EXAMINATION - CHRONOLOGICAL WALKTHROUGH
================================================================================

STRATEGY: Walk jury through the forensic analysis step-by-step in chronological
order, using visual aids to make technical concepts accessible.

---

Q12 (Direct): "Let's start at the beginning. When you received these files, what
               did you do first?"

A: "The first step in any forensic analysis is to preserve the evidence. I created
    exact copies of the files using forensic software, and I calculated what's
    called a SHA-256 hash - think of it as a unique fingerprint for each file.
    This ensures that any analysis I perform is on a copy, not the original, and
    that I can prove the files haven't been altered during my examination."

VISUAL AID: Display chain of custody documentation with SHA-256 hashes

---

Q13 (Direct): "After preserving the evidence, what did you examine first?"

A: "I started with the file headers - the first section of each file that contains
    basic information about when and how the file was created. This is similar to
    the cover page of a book that tells you the publisher and publication date."

VISUAL AID: Display hex dump of file header with annotations pointing to build
version location

---

Q14 (Direct): "What did you find in the file headers?"

A: "I found that Lane.rvt contains build version 20210224, which corresponds to
    a version of Revit released by Autodesk on February 24, 2021. Lane.0024
    contains build version 20210921, corresponding to September 21, 2021.

    Now, this is critical: The .0024 file has a name that suggests it's a backup
    or earlier version of Lane.rvt. In fact, in Revit, files with .000X extensions
    are automatic backups created during design work to preserve earlier states
    of the project.

    But the build version proves the .0024 file was created AFTER Lane.rvt, not
    before. This is forensically impossible for a legitimate backup."

VISUAL AID: Display side-by-side comparison of the two file headers with build
versions highlighted

---

Q15 (Direct): "Can you explain to the jury why this is impossible?"

A: "Certainly. Let me use an analogy. Imagine you're writing a book in Microsoft
    Word 2020. Every time you save your work, Word automatically creates a backup
    copy. Now, imagine someone shows you a backup file and claims it's from
    earlier in your writing process - but when you examine it, you find it was
    created with Microsoft Word 2022.

    That's impossible, right? How could a backup from earlier in your work be
    created with software that didn't exist yet? That's exactly what we have here.

    The .0024 file claims to be a backup or earlier version through its naming
    convention, but it was created with software released 7 months AFTER the
    primary file. The only explanation is that someone created this file later
    and gave it a name designed to make it look historical."

JURY NOTE: Analogy translates technical concept into relatable scenario

---

Q16 (Direct): "Could this be a mistake or a software error?"

A: "No. The build version is embedded in the software itself - it's compiled into
    the Revit program when Autodesk releases it. It's not something a user can
    change, and it's not affected by the computer's date and time settings. When
    you save a file in Revit, the build version of the software you're using is
    automatically written into the file header. There's no way for this to happen
    by accident."

---

Q17 (Direct): "What did you examine next?"

A: "Next, I analyzed the internal structure of both files. Revit files are
    organized into sections called partitions - you can think of them like
    chapters in a book. Each partition contains different types of design
    information: geometry, materials, annotations, and so on."

VISUAL AID: Display diagram of Revit file structure showing partitions

---

Q18 (Direct): "What did you find when you compared the partitions?"

A: "I found that Lane.0024 had a 3.2-megabyte partition that was marked as
    deleted. This same partition existed in Lane.rvt but was active - not deleted.
    This immediately raised a red flag. Why would a partition be deleted in the
    'backup' but active in the 'primary' file?"

---

Q19 (Direct): "Were you able to recover the deleted partition?"

A: "Yes. When Revit deletes data, it doesn't immediately overwrite it - similar
    to how deleting a file on your computer moves it to the recycle bin. Using
    forensic data recovery techniques, I was able to fully recover the contents
    of this deleted partition."

---

Q20 (Direct): "What did the deleted partition contain?"

A: "The deleted partition contained detailed design specifications for BBQ
    amenities. Specifically, I found 17 instances of the keyword 'BBQ' along
    with extensive design details."

VISUAL AID: Display keyword search results showing "BBQ" instances

---

Q21 (Direct): "Can you give the jury some examples of what you found?"

A: "Certainly. The recovered data included:

    - Element ID 'BBQ_AREA_001' with a description 'Outdoor BBQ Pavilion'
    - Equipment specifications for a 'Viking Professional Series' grill
    - Dimensions showing a 450-square-foot BBQ area
    - Material specifications including granite countertops spanning 22 linear feet
    - Utility infrastructure including gas lines and electrical service for the
      BBQ equipment
    - Related elements like outdoor seating, lighting fixtures, and landscaping

    This wasn't just a concept or a rough idea. This was a fully designed amenity
    with specific equipment models, exact dimensions, construction materials, and
    supporting infrastructure. This was ready for construction."

VISUAL AID: Display table showing recovered BBQ elements with specifications

JURY IMPACT: Specific details (Viking brand, 450 sq ft, granite counters) make
the evidence tangible and undermine any "it was just an idea" defense

---

Q22 (Direct): "Did you find these same BBQ elements in the Lane.rvt file?"

A: "Yes, absolutely. All of these elements - the BBQ pavilion, equipment, materials,
    utilities - are present and active in Lane.rvt. They were only deleted in the
    .0024 file. This proves the amenities were part of the original design and
    were specifically removed when the .0024 file was created."

VISUAL AID: Side-by-side comparison showing BBQ elements present in Lane.rvt,
deleted in Lane.0024

---

Q23 (Direct): "How do you know the deletion was intentional and not accidental?"

A: "Several factors prove intentional deletion:

    First, ALL BBQ-related elements were deleted - not just one or two items, but
    the entire amenity system: pavilion, equipment, counters, seating, lighting,
    utilities, landscaping. If this were accidental, you'd expect random items to
    be affected, not a complete, coordinated removal of one specific amenity.

    Second, the deletion was surgical - only BBQ elements were removed. Other
    amenities and design elements were left intact. This shows selective editing,
    not software malfunction or file corruption.

    Third, the deletion occurred at the same time the file was saved with a
    misleading name (.0024) using newer software. All these actions together -
    the deletion, the renaming, the timing - form a deliberate pattern."

---

Q24 (Direct): "You mentioned earlier that the .0024 file violates Revit's backup
               rules. Can you explain that?"

A: "Yes. Autodesk Revit has an automatic backup system. When you're working on a
    design, Revit periodically creates backup files with extensions .0001, .0002,
    .0003, and so on - sequential numbers for each backup.

    These automatic backups follow strict rules:
    1. They're created DURING your work session, so they must have earlier
       timestamps than the final file
    2. They're created by the SAME version of Revit you're currently using, so
       they must have the same build version
    3. They're sequential, so if you have a .0024 backup, you should have .0001
       through .0023 as well

    Lane.0024 violates ALL THREE rules:
    1. It has a LATER timestamp than Lane.rvt (impossible)
    2. It has a NEWER build version than Lane.rvt (impossible)
    3. No .0001 through .0023 files exist (not sequential)

    This proves Lane.0024 is not an automatic Revit backup. It's a manually
    created file that someone gave a backup-style name to make it look historical."

VISUAL AID: Display "Revit Backup Rules" chart showing how Lane.0024 violates
each rule

---

Q25 (Direct): "Based on all of this evidence, what is your expert conclusion?"

A: "It is my expert opinion, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that
    the file Lane.0024 was deliberately created in September 2021 - approximately
    7 months after Lane.rvt - by opening Lane.rvt (or a copy) in a newer version
    of Revit, systematically removing all BBQ amenity elements and related
    infrastructure, and saving the modified file with a .0024 extension to
    fraudulently represent it as an earlier backup version of the design.

    The chronological impossibility, the deleted partition containing detailed BBQ
    specifications, and the violation of Revit's backup conventions all support
    this conclusion. There is no innocent explanation that accounts for all of
    these forensic anomalies."

================================================================================
PHASE 3: CROSS-EXAMINATION DEFENSE
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Maintain credibility, defend methodology, and prevent opposing counsel
from creating reasonable doubt about core conclusions.

GENERAL STRATEGY:
- Answer only the question asked (don't volunteer information)
- Remain calm and professional under hostile questioning
- Redirect to strongest evidence when challenged
- Acknowledge limitations while emphasizing strength of core findings
- Use analogies to counter technical challenges

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 1: TOOL RELIABILITY

Q (Cross): "Mr./Ms. [Expert], you used custom-built software for this analysis,
            didn't you?"

A: "I used the DWG Forensic Tool, which I developed specifically for analyzing
    CAD and BIM file formats. However, every finding from that tool was
    independently verified using other forensic tools including ExifTool and
    manual hex editor analysis."

Q (Cross): "So you're asking this jury to trust software you built yourself?"

A: "No. I'm asking the jury to trust the FINDINGS, which were confirmed by
    multiple independent tools. For example, the build version 20210921 appears
    at a specific location in the file - offset 0x0B in the file header. Anyone
    with a hex editor can verify that. The build version isn't a calculation or
    interpretation - it's a direct reading of data from the file."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Emphasize that findings are independently verifiable, not
dependent on a single tool

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 2: BUILD VERSION SIGNIFICANCE

Q (Cross): "Isn't it true that build versions are just software labels and don't
            prove anything about when a file was created?"

A: "Build versions tell us which VERSION OF SOFTWARE was used to save the file.
    While they don't tell us the exact date and time the file was saved, they
    tell us the software couldn't have been earlier than the build release date.

    Let me use an analogy: If I show you a document created in Microsoft Word
    2023, you know it couldn't have been created in 2020, because Word 2023
    didn't exist yet. The build version works the same way.

    Lane.0024 was saved with Revit build 20210921, released September 21, 2021.
    Lane.rvt was saved with build 20210224, released February 24, 2021. This
    proves .0024 was created AFTER Lane.rvt, not before - which contradicts the
    backup naming convention."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Use accessible analogy to explain technical concept

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 3: ALTERNATIVE INNOCENT EXPLANATIONS

Q (Cross): "Couldn't the user have simply updated the file and saved it with a
            new name?"

A: "If that were the case, we'd expect to see:
    1. Content additions, not deletions (updates typically add features)
    2. A logical file name (like 'Lane_revised.rvt'), not a backup extension
    3. Both files preserved as separate design versions, not one presented as
       'original'

    Instead, we see systematic deletion of amenities and a misleading backup name.
    That's not a normal update - that's deliberate misrepresentation."

Q (Cross): "But you can't prove the person intended to deceive, can you?"

A: "I can't read minds. What I can prove is:
    - Content was deliberately deleted
    - The file was created later but named to appear earlier
    - The pattern is inconsistent with normal workflow
    Whether that constitutes legal intent to deceive is for the jury to decide
    based on all the evidence, not just my technical findings."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Acknowledge limits of technical evidence while maintaining
strength of core findings

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 4: MISSING CONTEXT

Q (Cross): "You never spoke to the person who created these files, did you?"

A: "No, I did not. Forensic analysis is based on the physical evidence - the
    files themselves - not on witness statements."

Q (Cross): "So you don't know why they made these changes?"

A: "I know WHAT changes were made, WHEN they were made relative to each other,
    and HOW they violate normal software operation. The WHY - the motivation -
    is outside the scope of forensic analysis."

Q (Cross): "So there could be an innocent explanation you're not aware of?"

A: "If there's an innocent explanation, it must account for all of the forensic
    evidence: the chronological impossibility, the deleted amenities, and the
    misleading naming convention. In my analysis, I considered every plausible
    innocent explanation - software bugs, user error, automatic processes,
    corruption - and ruled each out based on the evidence. If opposing counsel
    has an explanation that accounts for all the forensic anomalies, I'm open to
    evaluating it."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Challenge opposing counsel to provide alternative explanation
that fits ALL the evidence

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 5: OVERSTATING CONCLUSIONS

Q (Cross): "You used the word 'fraudulent' in your report, didn't you?"

A: "I described the file as fraudulently named - meaning it was given a name that
    misrepresents its nature. The .0024 extension implies it's an automatic
    backup, but forensic evidence proves it's not."

Q (Cross): "But you're not accusing anyone of fraud, are you?"

A: "I'm testifying to technical facts: the file was manipulated, content was
    deleted, and the naming is misleading. Whether those actions constitute legal
    fraud is a determination for the jury, not for me as a technical expert."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Clarify difference between technical findings (file is
misleading) and legal conclusions (fraud)

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 6: CONFIDENCE LEVEL

Q (Cross): "You said you're 95% confident. That means you could be wrong, correct?"

A: "In science, we express confidence statistically. 95% confidence is the
    standard for high certainty - it's the same threshold used for FDA drug
    approvals, engineering safety standards, and forensic DNA evidence.

    The remaining 5% represents scientific humility - the acknowledgment that
    absolute certainty is impossible in empirical analysis. But 95% confidence
    means the evidence is overwhelming and the conclusion is as certain as
    scientific method allows."

Q (Cross): "So there's a 5% chance you're completely wrong?"

A: "No. There's a 95% probability the conclusion is correct based on the available
    evidence, and a 5% probability that some unknown factor might provide an
    alternative explanation. But no such factor has been identified despite
    extensive analysis."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Explain scientific confidence properly and defend 95% as
high-certainty standard

---

ANTICIPATED ATTACK 7: SPECULATION ABOUT AUTHOR

Q (Cross): "You don't know who created the .0024 file, do you?"

A: "The file metadata shows [author name if available], but I have not
    independently verified the author's identity. My analysis focuses on the
    file's technical properties, not the human actor."

Q (Cross): "So someone else could have created it without the author's knowledge?"

A: "That's possible, though it would require access to the original file and
    technical knowledge of Revit. Regardless of WHO created it, the forensic
    findings remain the same: the file was deliberately manipulated and
    misleadingly named."

REDIRECT STRATEGY: Separate technical findings from questions of human agency

================================================================================
PHASE 4: REDIRECT EXAMINATION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Clarify any points obscured during cross-examination and reinforce
the strongest evidence before jury deliberation.

---

Q (Redirect): "The defense attorney suggested there might be an innocent
               explanation for these findings. In your expert opinion, is there
               any innocent explanation consistent with all the forensic evidence?"

A: "No. I specifically looked for innocent explanations during my analysis. I
    considered software bugs, automatic processes, user error, file corruption,
    and normal design evolution. None of these explain the combination of:
    1. Build version impossibility (backup newer than primary)
    2. Systematic deletion of specific amenities
    3. Misleading backup naming convention

    An innocent explanation must account for ALL THREE. I haven't found one, and
    the defense hasn't proposed one."

---

Q (Redirect): "You were asked about your custom forensic tool. Did you rely solely
               on that tool for your conclusions?"

A: "No. The build version finding was verified three ways: my tool, ExifTool, and
    manual hex editor analysis. All three methods showed the same result - build
    20210921 in Lane.0024 and build 20210224 in Lane.rvt. This isn't dependent on
    any single tool. It's a fact encoded in the file structure."

---

Q (Redirect): "The defense suggested you're biased because you were hired by the
               plaintiff. How do you respond?"

A: "My methodology is objective. I use the same tools and techniques regardless of
    who hires me. I follow NIST and ISO standards that are recognized in courts
    worldwide. My conclusions are based on forensic evidence, not client preference.
    If the evidence had shown Lane.0024 was legitimate, I would have reported that,
    regardless of who was paying my hourly rate. My professional reputation depends
    on objectivity."

---

Q (Redirect): "In your expert opinion, what is the single most important piece of
               evidence in this case?"

A: "The chronological impossibility. A backup file cannot be created with software
    released 7 months AFTER the file it supposedly backs up. This is not subjective
    interpretation - it's a logical impossibility. Everything else - the deleted
    amenities, the misleading name - is supporting evidence. But the build version
    alone proves this file is not what it appears to be."
