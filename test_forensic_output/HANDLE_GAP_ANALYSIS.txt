HANDLE GAP ANALYSIS - CONTENT DELETION EVIDENCE
================================================================================
Case: 2026-001 - Kara Murphy vs Danny Garcia

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total Files Analyzed: 38
Files with Handle Gaps: 0
Total Handle Gaps Detected: 0


METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handle gaps are discontinuities in the sequential object handle numbering
system used by AutoCAD. Each object in a DWG file receives a unique handle
(hexadecimal identifier). When objects are deleted, gaps appear in the
sequence. These gaps provide forensic evidence of content modification.

Forensic Significance:
  - Handle gaps prove objects were created then deleted
  - Number of gaps indicates extent of modification
  - Large gaps suggest bulk deletion operations
  - Patterns across files suggest coordinated modification

LITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Depose defendant regarding deleted objects:
   - What objects were deleted and why?
   - When were deletions made?
   - Were deletions made in anticipation of litigation?

2. Cross-reference handle gaps with deposition testimony:
   - Defendant claims drawings are 'original' or 'unmodified'
   - Handle gaps prove modification occurred

3. Expert witness testimony:
   - Handle gap analysis demonstrates spoliation of evidence
   - Coordinated deletion pattern suggests intentional concealment
